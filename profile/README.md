### User Experience: Passkey Sign-In and Exclusive Perks

> [!NOTE]  
> The creation of passkeys on Cross-Origin Iframe (as it's the case here) is not yet supported on iOS. It should be available on future versions as it's on the specs of the WebAuthn standard Level 3. For more information, see [this article](https://www.corbado.com/blog/iframe-passkeys-webauthn#32-create-passkeys-in-cross-origin-iframes).
